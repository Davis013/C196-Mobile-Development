# C196-Mobile-Development
This covers C196 Mobile Development

Technical Specs: This application was designed using Android Studio, using Java as the programming language

Purpose of the Project: The purpose of the project was to design a mobile application for the Android platform that would allow the user to access the application (Student Term Tracker) and keep track of their current term information such as (Term name, classes in term,
and information for the classes I.E tests, papers, tasks.) The application also allows the user to add new term information to the application, as well as classes and the required course curriculum information. There is a validation check in place to ensure that the user
cannot delete any terms that have courses assigned to them. The application allows for notifications to come through when the application is closed, alerting the user that a course or specific task has begun or end depending on the start or end date of the course or task.
To enable notifications for the courses or tasks the option notify course or notify task must be selected on the Add/Edit Course Information or Add/Edit Assessment Information. If the option has not been selected then the user will not recieve notifications to their device.

There is more how to run the application in the README.txt included in the project file as well as the API used to create/run the tests for this application
